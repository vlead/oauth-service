- To Build a Oauth Service to that allows authorization between microservices
  and to have an authentication service for the user.

* Problem

  authorization is required between the services. 

* Solution
In a nutshell: Be able to create a system where you can  "Login with VLABS
Account" for each of the services.

* Process

** Implementing it on a small scale.
- Trying to create a small version of an oauth service. (Looking for open
  source solutions)
