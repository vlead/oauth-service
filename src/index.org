* Future Work
** Milestone-II
  Now instead of signing in through the credentials, the user should
  be able to sign in through omniauths such as google or facebook.

  Once clicked onto the link the user should be redirected to Google
  or Facebook login page and once successfully signed in should
  redirect back to the respective VLEAD portal.

** Milestone-III
  Integrate the various VLEAD prortals eg.LDS dashboard.
  
  Devlop several new packages for different VLEAD portals for easy
  integration with CAS.
