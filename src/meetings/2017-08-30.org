* Introduction 
  This week was devoted in making a demo CAS server which
  could be further build up to make the cas server 
  .

* Issues Completed/Faced
** [[../feature-realization-plan/index.org::Prerequisites::Issues::Learning%20the%20Spring%20MVC][Learning Spring MVC]]   
   CAS is written Spring MVC in JAVA Though it is a highly used
   framework, understaning the working of its various components.


** [[%20../feature-realization-plan/index.org::#prerequisites_issue][CAS documentation]]
   CAS has a huge documentation and can take some time to underdtand
   the its working.
 

** [[%20../feature-realization-plan/index.org::#milestone1_issue][Multiple VLEAD projects would have a single login]]
   Documentation of the code for the cas server for VLEAD [[../cas-pac4j-oauth-demo/index.org][here]]

** [[%20../feature-realization-plan/index.org::milestone1_issue][Portal for users to log in ]]
   Using the inbuilt webapp of CAS we have made a small demo serivce
   Currently it takes an user/password both are *leleuj*

** Updated  in the planning
   I have added more issues in the planning.org to justify work done
   this week and more issues will be faces in the next week.
   
** Google Single Sign on
   While attempting to use google-sign-on, it requires us to make a paid
   account in G suite to use its CAS sigle-sign on. 
   
   The amount is 5$ per month and also has a free for 14 days. 

   Hence I have refrained from going further with it.

* Work done previous week 
  Prevous week major focus was on:
  1. Trying to make an cas-overlay-template which contains only the pom.xml  
  2. We were learning maven to easily build the project in java
  3. Using Google and generating the RSA keys to be stored to communicate with google.

* Plan for next week( New issues to be added)
  1. Integrate the CAS server with the LDS dashboard of VLEAD CAS
     generates tickets on successful login and how to transfer
     these tickets to the client server.
  2. Update the CAS server. As CAS is still in demo phase we need to
     make it much better and add various dependencies, configure the servlet, add view.
