** Explanation
[[../design/diagrams/abstract_flow.png][Flow of Information]]

4 Components : 

*** Resource Owner

- This is the User. The user wants to interact with the client(application)

*** Client

- Client is the Application that wants access to the user's account. Before it
  receives access, the user must authorize it to do so.

*** Resource / Authorization Server

- Protects the User's data and verifies the authenticity of the user. It then
  issues access tokens to the client.

* Oauth Info

** Client
- Needs to register with the authorization server
*** Registration
- Needs to provide what type of client(Confidential or Public section 2.1 of
  oauth documentation) and redirect URIs(and any additional info like: (e.g.,
  application name, website, description, logo image, the acceptance of legal
  terms).).
- Needs some form of authentication with the auth server. may have a client
  password or some form of public/private key security measure. The degree of
  security is to be determined by the needs of the auth server.
** Protocol Endpoints
*** Authorization Endpoint
- Where the resource is interacted with to get authorization grant.
- Auth server must use TLS for transmission to auth endpoint
*** Redirection Endpoint
- Must be an absolute URI
